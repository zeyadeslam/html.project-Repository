History Of OS
Operating systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage
The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701
In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks
In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed
The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS. It was built in 1981 by purchasing the 86-DOS software from a Seattle company
The present-day popular OS Windows first came to existence in 1985 when a GUI was created and paired with MS-DOS.
The first operating system created by Microsoft was not called Windows, it was called MS-DOS and it was built in 1981 when it bought the 86-DOS operating system from Seattle Computer Products and modified it to meet IBM requirements.

The Windows name was first used in 1985 when a graphical user interface was created and paired or joined with the MS-DOS.

Today Apple, OS X, Microsoft Windows and the various forms of Linux (including Android) dominate the vast majority of the modern operating systems market, as we saw earlier.Video Operating Systems

Most software programs are designed to work with the operating system of a single company, for example only Windows (Microsoft) or only macOS (Apple).
