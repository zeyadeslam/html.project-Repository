What Does an Operating System Do?
An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.

Operating systems also include a lot of software—things like common system services, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can use to write programs that run on the operating system.

The operating system sits in between the applications you run and the hardware, using the ha…Operating System as an Extended Machine

It is not just about the floppy disk. You may be wondering, who writes that much onto an external drive anyway? Well, that isn’t the only thing the operating system helps with. This function of the operating system covers all major interactions with the hardware. 
All computers need an operating system to function. A computer's hardware – its monitor, keyboard, hard drives and memory – are like the bones and muscles in your body, which need guidance and direction to function. Your brain – the operating system – provides the direction, coordinating all the mechanics of your computer to turn this collection of machinery into a functional tool.
